We Have in this Project 2 folders one contain backend  called (database)
and the other contain front end  called(Login-page)


open the database files in vscode and use npm i express , npm i cors , npm run dev (we used xampp and we started apache and mysql)
then use npm run dev 
the database we used was on localhost and we tried to share it but we failed

then open the login files in vscode and from index.html you can start the website by go live stream


In the login page on the website we can access through only some users from Java script code 
Like : UserName:Ahmed Khaled , password:123


if you try another user or password it will not go to another page.


the second page which will go after index.html
it's welcome page 
you have burger style bar and from it details of (Contact us (send to my mail message), Doctors(show doctors details) , Nurses(show Nurses details))

we have 3 button in this page 
Add patient (you will go to form when complete it it direct go to check patient page data)
Check patient(show all details of patient)
statstics (show rooms,capacity,room number)

((the server of database i can't upload it ))
